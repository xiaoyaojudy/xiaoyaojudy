# Data Analytics Portfolio - Yao(Judy) XIAO

This repository is containing portfolio of data science and data analyst projects/assignments completed by me (or with team) to showcase the practical knowledge and skills that I gained from the Bootcamp that I participated. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks, Javascript, HTML, etc. Keeping learning and practicing...

### Data Visualization - Matplotlib
* Code: [[Click Here](https://github.com/xiaoyaojudy/Challenge_5/blob/main/pymaceuticals_starter%20-%20Xiao_Yao.ipynb)]
* Goal: The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. 
* Background: Pymaceuticals Inc. is a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. 
* Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, data visualization, linear regression
* Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Scikit-learn

### Fitbit Tracker Dataset Analysis
* Code: [[Click Here](https://github.com/Enimien/project_1_healthcare.git))]
* Goal: Analyze FitBit fitness tracker data to gain insights into how consumers are using the FitBit app and give recommendations to the public on how to live a better and healthier life based on the results that we found using the data.
* Description: Data is publicly available on Kaggle 33 FitBit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data. Data collected includes physical activity recorded in hours, heart rate, sleep monitoring, daily activity, steps and calories.
* Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization
* Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy
  
### ETL Mini Project
* Code: [[Click Here](https://github.com/xiaoyaojudy/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/main/ETL_Mini_Project_YXiao.ipynb)]
* Goal: To build an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data.
* Skills: data extraction, transformation, and loading
  
### Interactive Visualization - JavaScript with D3.js
* Code: [[Click Here](https://github.com/xiaoyaojudy/belly-button-challenge.git)]
* Goal: To build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
* Description: The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
* Technology: Plotly, JavaScript
* [Dashboard](https://xiaoyaojudy.github.io/belly-button-challenge/)
  
### Mapping - Data Visualization with Leaflet
* Code: [[Click Here](https://github.com/xiaoyaojudy/leaflet-challenge.git)]
* Goal: To develop a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.
* Background: The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.
* Technology: JavaScript, HTML, D3 library, GeoJSON
* Visualization: [Click Here](https://github.com/xiaoyaojudy/leaflet-challenge/blob/main/index.html)
  
### Supervised Machine Learning
* Code: [[Click Here](https://github.com/xiaoyaojudy/credit-risk-classification.git)]
* Goal: To use machine learning to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk; to use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
* Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn
* Results:
  
### Handwriting Sentiment Classifier
* Code: [[Click Here](https://github.com/Ernawaty2024/handwriting_sentiment_classifier/blob/main/ModelData.ipynb)]
* Description: [README](https://github.com/Ernawaty2024/handwriting_sentiment_classifier/blob/main/README.md)
* Skills: machine learning
* Technology: Python, Scikit-learn, HTML, Flask, CSS
* Results:
