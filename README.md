# Data Analytics Portfolio - Yao(Judy) XIAO

This repository showcases a collection of data science and data analysis projects and assignments that I have completed, either individually or as part of a team. These projects highlight the practical skills and knowledge I gained during my participation in a comprehensive Data Analytics Bootcamp. The portfolio includes work presented in various formats such as Jupyter Notebooks, JavaScript, HTML, and more.

My goal is to continually learn, practice, and refine my abilities in data analysis, machine learning, and programming. Through this repository, I aim to demonstrate my proficiency in solving real-world problems, utilizing a wide range of tools and techniques in data science.

### Data Visualization - Matplotlib

* **Background:** Pymaceuticals Inc. is a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured.
* **Goal:** The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
* **Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, data visualization, linear regression
* **Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Scikit-learn 
* **Code:** [[Click Here](https://github.com/xiaoyaojudy/Challenge_5/blob/main/pymaceuticals_starter%20-%20Xiao_Yao.ipynb)]

### Interactive Visualization - JavaScript with D3.js

* **Goal:** To build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
* **Description:** The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
* **Technology:** Plotly, JavaScript
* **Code:** [[Click Here](https://github.com/xiaoyaojudy/belly-button-challenge.git)]

### Mapping - Data Visualization with Leaflet

* **Background:** The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.
* **Goal:** To develop a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.
* **Technology:** JavaScript, HTML, D3 library, GeoJSON
* **Code:** [[Click Here](https://github.com/xiaoyaojudy/leaflet-challenge.git)]
* **Visualization:**

### Supervised Machine Learning

* **Goal:** To use machine learning to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk; to use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
* **Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn
* **Code:** [[Click Here](https://github.com/xiaoyaojudy/credit-risk-classification.git)]

### Fitbit Tracker Dataset Analysis

* **Goal:** Analyze FitBit fitness tracker data to gain insights into how consumers are using the FitBit app and give recommendations to the public on how to live a better and healthier life based on the results that we found using the data.
* **Description:** Data is publicly available on Kaggle. 33 FitBit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data. Data collected includes physical activity recorded in hours, heart rate, sleep monitoring, daily activity, steps and calories.
* **Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization
* **Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy
* **Code:** [[Click Here](https://github.com/Enimien/project_1_healthcare.git)]
  
### ETL Mini Project

* **Goal:** To build an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data.
* **Skills:** data extraction, transformation, and loading
* **Code:** [[Click Here](https://github.com/xiaoyaojudy/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/main/ETL_Mini_Project_YXiao.ipynb)]
  
### Handwriting Sentiment Classifier

* **Description:** [README](https://github.com/Ernawaty2024/handwriting_sentiment_classifier/blob/main/README.md)
* **Skills:** machine learning
* **Technology:** Python, Scikit-learn, HTML, Flask, CSS
* **Code:** [[Click Here](https://github.com/Ernawaty2024/handwriting_sentiment_classifier/blob/main/ModelData.ipynb)]
